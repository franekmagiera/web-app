# Wikidata Explorer 

[Live demo](https://franekmagiera.github.io/wikidata-explorer/)

A simple project for the Linked Open Data and Knowledge Graphs university course.
The website enables the user to search for entities inside of wikidata and execute SPARQL queries. The retrieved data can be downloaded as a JSON file.

The website is built with React, Reactstrap and Bootstrap and is based on create-react-app. It is using [Wikibase-sdk](https://github.com/maxlath/wikibase-sdk) to search and query wikidata.
